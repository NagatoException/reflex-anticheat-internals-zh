[//]: # (### ⚡️ TL;DR — Anticheat is not updated. New materials may be published in this repository if you ask. Still answering questions and talking to the community. Most Reflex's anticheating techniques are still relevant.)
### ⚡️ TL;DR — 反作弊插件不再更新。如果您有任何问题，可以在本存储库中提出。我们仍然会回答问题并与社区交流。大多数 Reflex 的反作弊技术依然有效。

[//]: # (Reflex has been released for free. Anyone can use it on their servers and share it however they like. We're additionally sharing a lot of under-the-hood details so that the developers/maintainers of modern, still alive anticheats can maybe incorporate some ideas in their works. We believe that this way the entire Minecraft community can benefit from what we've been doing for the last few years.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We are not going to continue developing Reflex anymore. Even no critical updates. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We are not releasing the entire source code, either. There's a number of reasons for that, including the fact that the sources aren't of the "best" quality and may be hard to maintain, and because some of them have been incorporated in the anticheat that [I'm][dev-german] privately developing for a server now. Anyway, we've still released what we believe is quite enough for the community to use.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (But the team isn't dead right now, and isn't "dying fully" anytime soon. **[Our Discord server][discord]** is still alive, and this repository welcomes any **issues** or **pull requests**. That said, if you believe that the released data is missing something crucial, or you just have general questions or anything to ask about Reflex or us, feel free to let us know, and we'll try to answer soon! This repository isn't exhaustive, and we may be updating it with new publications, if needed. Just tell us what you'd like to see!)

Reflex 已经免费发布。 任何人都可以在其服务器上使用它，并以任何方式共享它。 我们还额外分享了很多底层细节，以便现代仍然活跃的反作弊插件的开发人员/维护人员可以将一些想法纳入他们的作品中。 我们相信，这样整个 Minecraft 社区都可以从我们过去几年所做的事情中受益。


[//]: # (### But wait — if checks' details are now public, aren't they all instantly useless? Hackers will read them and bypass everything!)
### 但是等等 - 如果检查细节现在是公开的，它们不都立即无用了吗？ 黑客会阅读它们并绕过所有检查！

[//]: # (No, not really.)
并不一定。

[//]: # (Firstly, there is an unholy number of hacked clients and injectable cheats that are no longer maintained, but still used by a bunch of people. These will obviously remain detected by Reflex forever. And, believe it or not, the number of cheaters who still rely on those outdated hacks is surprising!)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Secondly, Reflex didn't rely on the so-called **[security through obscurity][security-through-obscurity]** principles. Yes, there *are* some checks that do. But many of Reflex's techniques might be tricky to bypass even though their implementation details and code snippets are published and explained.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Thirdly, we hope that some of the active anticheat developers will not just grab what we published, but understand how and why our methods work &#40;and why they sometimes don't&#41;, and use them as an inspiration to create new, more advanced and thorough anticheat solutions that cover the holes that our publications might have exposed.)

首先，有一些不受支持但仍被一群人使用的黑客客户端和可注入作弊软件。 这些显然将永远被 Reflex 检测到。 不管你信不信，仍然依赖这些过时黑客的作弊者的数量仍然很多！

其次，Reflex 不依赖所谓的 **[隐晦式安全][security-through-obscurity]** 原则。 是的，确实有 **一些** 检查。 但是，即使发布和解释了其实现细节和代码片段，Reflex 的许多技术也可能很难绕过。

最后，我们希望一些活跃的反作弊开发人员不仅仅是打滑我们发布的内容，而是了解我们的方法如何以及为什么工作（以及为什么有时不工作），并将其用作灵感来创建新的更先进和彻底的反作弊解决方案，以弥补我们的反作弊可能暴露的漏洞。
