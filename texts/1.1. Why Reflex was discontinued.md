[//]: # (Developing an anticheat is literally playing a cat and mouse game: ingenious cheat developers, seeing and disliking the fact that the cheats they develop are starting to be detected and blocked, are spending a lot of *time* to come up with crafty ideas of circumventing the current detection techniques; then the anticheat devs have to catch up and discover even more creative and tricky ways to detect those new cheats, dedicating even more *time* into that; and then the cycle repeats.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (*Time* was the main concern. [I &#40;DarksideCode/German&#41;][dev-german], who was mainly responsible for most of the actual anticheating part, started the project in my spare time. I loved doing what I did, and it was kinda like just a small hobby, but as the project was growing ang gaining attention, I had to start putting more and more effort in it. At some point, that started clashing severely with my studies; I then also got a job &#40;initially, also to develop a private anticheat&#41;, and so I simply started running out of time. I've never tried advertising Reflex more aggressively or adding more "good selling" features like many other developers dead, because I simply didn't really care that much. But that also resulted in the fact that Reflex didn't produce that much revenue, in reality. It's not to complain, but at some point I decided to spend even less time on it because "it's not so important". )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (And one day I saw someone in our Discord's *#talk* asking something like "where's Reflex?" — and that was the moment I realized it was deleted from SpigotMC. I still had plans on keeping the project up, I was still planning about updating it some time, the day before. *"Just a bit later"*, I thought. In my opinion, though, Reflex was deleted from the platform too early; especially given that it was a pretty big project with over a thousand customers. I didn't even get any warning. And I knew that projects are normally moved to the *InactiveResource* author before being deleted, so I did occasionally check if it's not too late. But surprise-surprise. There are plugins that haven't been updated for even longer, but still weren't deleted at that date. One can produce many speculations here, but one that we believe in our team could be simply tied to the world events that started happening close to that date **&#40;March 2022&#41;** and the fact that I'm Russian.)

[//]: # (Everybody in the dev team was really upset at the day. But, again, since I haven't had that much spare time, and, in fact, was extremely busy with my university studies and new job at that moment, I just didn't feel like doing anything. I believed that just giving up on everything was a bad idea, but I also didn't want to do something real, like moving to another platform and continueing the project from there. There were also other factors that influenced my final decision, such as the code base being pretty old and hardly maintainable, and me already having some anticheat-related work in another place. As the result, a decision was made to fully discontinue the Reflex Anticheat project.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Since Reflex was still quite in demand, and simply shutting it down could affect a lot of servers running there; as well as to help new servers and admins looking for a good anticheat, we decided to release Reflex for free for everyone. A promise was made to do that soon at that time, but, again, due to the lack of time and simply my stupidity in some aspects, this event was delayed this much, for which I'm extremely sorry!)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (But anyway, it was much fun working on Reflex Anticheat and talking to all of our customers and community members, and we really appreciate the fact that many of you are still interested in the project and keep asking about it every now and then! Thank you all for this awesome journey!)

开发一款反作弊插件就像玩猫和老鼠游戏一样：狡猾的外挂开发人员看到了他们开发的作弊开始被检测和阻止的事实，他们花了很多*时间*想出了绕过当前检测技术的巧妙想法；然后反作弊开发人员必须赶上并发现更多创造性和巧妙的方法来检测这些新作弊，为此投入了更多*时间*；然后循环重复。

*时间*是主要问题。 [我（DarksideCode/German）][dev-german]，主要负责大部分实际反作弊部分的人，在业余时间开始了这个项目。我喜欢做我所做的事情，这有点像只是一个小爱好，但是随着项目的发展和吸引力的增加，我不得不开始投入越来越多的精力。在某些时候，这开始严重影响我的学习；然后我也找到了一份工作（最初也是为了开发私人反作弊），所以我简单地没有时间了。我从来没有试图更积极地宣传 Reflex 或添加更多“好卖”的功能，就像许多其他开发人员一样，因为我根本不太在乎。但是这也导致 Reflex 实际上没有产生太多收入。这不是在抱怨，但是在某些时候，我决定花更少的时间在它上面，因为“它并不重要”。

有一天，我在我们的 Discord 的 *#talk* 中看到有人问“Reflex 在哪里？” ——那时刻我意识到它已从 SpigotMC 中删除的。前一天，我还计划着继续保持这个项目，我还在考虑什么时候更新它。我想着，“再晚点吧”，但是在我看来，Reflex 太早从平台上删除了；尤其是考虑到它是一个拥有一千多个客户的大型项目。我甚至没有得到任何警告。我知道项目通常会在被删除之前移至 *InactiveResource* 作者，所以我偶尔会检查一下是否还来得及。但惊喜来了。有一些插件甚至更新时间更久，但到那个日期还未被删除。这里可以有很多猜测，但我们团队认为其中一个可能原因与 **（2022年3月）** 开始发生的世界事件，以及我是俄罗斯人这个事实有关。

团队中的每个人在那天都非常沮丧。但是，再次，由于我没有那么多的空闲时间，而且实际上在我忙于大学学习和新工作的时候，我只是不想做任何事情。我认为放弃一切只是一个坏主意，但我也不想做一些实质性的事情，比如转移到另一个平台并继续从那里进行项目。还有其他因素影响了我的最终决定，例如代码库非常古老且难以维护，而且我已经在另一个地方做了一些反作弊相关的工作。结果，决定完全停止 Reflex 反作弊项目。

由于 Reflex 仍然非常受欢迎，而且简单地关闭它可能会影响许多运行在那里的服务器；以及帮助寻找良好反作弊插件的新服务器和管理员，我们决定为所有人免费发布 Reflex。当时承诺很快就会这样做，但是，由于时间不足和我在某些方面的愚蠢，这一事件被推迟了这么久，对此我非常抱歉！

但无论如何，开发 Reflex 反作弊项目和与所有客户和社区成员交流是非常有趣的，我们真的很感激许多人仍然对这个项目感兴趣，并不时询问有关它的情况！感谢大家共同经历了这段美妙的旅程！
